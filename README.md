  ## Description
Welcome to the Lair of the Sphinx. Within you will find myriad monsters with which to do battle. Unlike many monsters that will challenge adventurers physically, The ones within the Sphinx's lair challenge explorers mentally. When you run into a monster within you will be asked one or more riddles. In order to slay the monster you must answer the question it poses to you correctly. If you are incorrect it will damage you. Once you reach 0 HP you will be removed from the dungeon and have to start over from the begining. All questions will have a one word answer (ie: "bird" as opposed to "a bird").

Do you think you have what it takes to challenge the mighty Sphinx? Gather your armor and armaments. May your wit be as sharp as your sword...
